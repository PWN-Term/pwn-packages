This project contains scripts and patches to build packages for the [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)
Android application.

Quick how-to about Termux package management is available at [Package Management](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Package-Management). It also has info on how to fix **`repository is under maintenance or down`** errors when running `apt` or `pkg` commands.

## Contributing

**@termux is looking for help with fixing issues, adding new packages and maintaining
existing ones. It would be very helpful if you submit a pull request with bug fixes.**

Processing of new package requests is limited. Repository is already big and recently
we got the [new problems with hosting](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6348).
Submit requests only for things that can be important for most users.

Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Developer's Wiki](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki) for more details.
