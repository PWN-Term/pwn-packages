.SH "NAME"

\fBapt\-mark\fR {\fB\-f=\fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR | {auto\ |\ manual}\ \fIpkg\fR...  | {showauto\ |\ showmanual}\ [\fIpkg\fR...] } | {\-v\ |\ \-\-version} | {\-h\ |\ \-\-help}

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt\-mark\fR
can be used as a unified front\-end to set various settings for a package, such as marking a package as being automatically/manually installed or changing
\fBdpkg\fR
selections such as hold, install, deinstall and purge which are respected e\&.g\&. by
\fBapt\-get dselect\-upgrade\fR
or
\fBaptitude\fR\&.
.SH "AUTOMATICALLY AND MANUALLY INSTALLED PACKAGES"
.PP
When you request that a package is installed, and as a result other packages are installed to satisfy its dependencies, the dependencies are marked as being automatically installed, while the package you installed explicitly is marked as manually installed\&. Once an automatically installed package is no longer depended on by any manually installed package it is considered no longer needed and e\&.g\&.
\fBapt\-get\fR
or
\fBaptitude\fR
will at least suggest removing them\&.
.PP
\fBauto\fR
.RS 4
auto
is used to mark a package as being automatically installed, which will cause the package to be removed when no more manually installed packages depend on this package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmanual\fR
.RS 4
manual
is used to mark a package as being manually installed, which will prevent the package from being automatically removed if no other packages depend on it\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshowauto\fR
.RS 4
showauto
is used to print a list of automatically installed packages with each package on a new line\&. All automatically installed packages will be listed if no package is given\&. If packages are given only those which are automatically installed will be shown\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshowmanual\fR
.RS 4
showmanual
can be used in the same way as
showauto
except that it will print a list of manually installed packages instead\&.
.RE
.SS "Options"
.PP
\fB\-f=\fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR, \fB\-\-file=\fR\fB\fIfilename\fR\fR
.RS 4
Read/Write package stats from the filename given with the parameter
\fIfilename\fR
instead of from the default location, which is
extended_status
in the directory defined by the Configuration Item:
Dir::State\&.
.RE
.SH "PREVENT CHANGES FOR A PACKAGE"
.PP
\fBhold\fR
.RS 4
hold
is used to mark a package as held back, which will prevent the package from being automatically installed, upgraded or removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunhold\fR
.RS 4
unhold
is used to cancel a previously set hold on a package to allow all actions again\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshowhold\fR
.RS 4
showhold
is used to print a list of packages on hold in the same way as for the other show commands\&.
.RE
.SH "SCHEDULE PACKAGES FOR INSTALL, REMOVE AND PURGE"
.PP
Some front\-ends like
\fBapt\-get dselect\-upgrade\fR
can be used to apply previously scheduled changes to the install state of packages\&. Such changes can be scheduled with the
\fBinstall\fR,
\fBremove\fR
(also known as
\fBdeinstall\fR) and
\fBpurge\fR
commands\&. Packages with a specific selection can be displayed with
\fBshowinstall\fR,
\fBshowremove\fR
and
\fBshowpurge\fR
respectively\&. More information about these so called dpkg selections can be found in
\fBdpkg\fR(1)\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Show a short usage summary\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Show the program version\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-config\-file\fR
.RS 4
Configuration File; Specify a configuration file to use\&. The program will read the default configuration file and then this configuration file\&. If configuration settings need to be set before the default configuration files are parsed specify a file with the
\fBAPT_CONFIG\fR
environment variable\&. See
\fBapt.conf\fR(5)
for syntax information\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-option\fR
.RS 4
Set a Configuration Option; This will set an arbitrary configuration option\&. The syntax is
\fB\-o Foo::Bar=bar\fR\&.
\fB\-o\fR
and
\fB\-\-option\fR
can be used multiple times to set different options\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.PP
/var/lib/apt/extended_states
.RS 4
Status list of auto\-installed packages\&. Configuration Item:
Dir::State::extended_states\&.

.SH "SEE ALSO"

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"

\fBapt\-mark\fR
returns zero on normal operation, non\-zero on error\&.
.SH "BUGS"
.PP
