.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBapt\-cache\fR
performs a variety of operations on APT\*(Aqs package cache\&.
\fBapt\-cache\fR
does not manipulate the state of the system but does provide operations to search and generate interesting output from the package metadata\&. The metadata is acquired and updated via the \*(Aqupdate\*(Aq command of e\&.g\&.
\fBapt\-get\fR, so that it can be outdated if the last update is too long ago, but in exchange
\fBapt\-cache\fR
works independently of the availability of the configured sources (e\&.g\&. offline)\&.
.PP
Unless the
\fB\-h\fR, or
\fB\-\-help\fR
option is given, one of the commands below must be present\&.
.PP
\fBgencaches\fR
.RS 4
gencaches
creates APT\*(Aqs package cache\&. This is done implicitly by all commands needing this cache if it is missing or outdated\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshowpkg\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
showpkg
displays information about the packages listed on the command line\&. Remaining arguments are package names\&. The available versions and reverse dependencies of each package listed are listed, as well as forward dependencies for each version\&. Forward (normal) dependencies are those packages upon which the package in question depends; reverse dependencies are those packages that depend upon the package in question\&. Thus, forward dependencies must be satisfied for a package, but reverse dependencies need not be\&. For instance,
\fBapt\-cache showpkg libreadline2\fR
would produce output similar to the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Package: libreadline2
Versions: 2\&.1\-12(/var/state/apt/lists/foo_Packages),
Reverse Depends: 
  libreadlineg2,libreadline2
  libreadline2\-altdev,libreadline2
Dependencies:
2\&.1\-12 \- libc5 (2 5\&.4\&.0\-0) ncurses3\&.0 (0 (null))
Provides:
2\&.1\-12 \- 
Reverse Provides: 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
Thus it may be seen that libreadline2, version 2\&.1\-12, depends on libc5 and ncurses3\&.0 which must be installed for libreadline2 to work\&. In turn, libreadlineg2 and libreadline2\-altdev depend on libreadline2\&. If libreadline2 is installed, libc5 and ncurses3\&.0 (and ldso) must also be installed; libreadlineg2 and libreadline2\-altdev do not have to be installed\&. For the specific meaning of the remainder of the output it is best to consult the apt source code\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBstats\fR
.RS 4
stats
displays some statistics about the cache\&. No further arguments are expected\&. Statistics reported are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Total package names
is the number of package names found in the cache\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Normal packages
is the number of regular, ordinary package names; these are packages that bear a one\-to\-one correspondence between their names and the names used by other packages for them in dependencies\&. The majority of packages fall into this category\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Pure virtual packages
is the number of packages that exist only as a virtual package name; that is, packages only "provide" the virtual package name, and no package actually uses the name\&. For instance, "mail\-transport\-agent" in the Debian system is a pure virtual package; several packages provide "mail\-transport\-agent", but there is no package named "mail\-transport\-agent"\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Single virtual packages
is the number of packages with only one package providing a particular virtual package\&. For example, in the Debian system, "X11\-text\-viewer" is a virtual package, but only one package, xless, provides "X11\-text\-viewer"\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Mixed virtual packages
is the number of packages that either provide a particular virtual package or have the virtual package name as the package name\&. For instance, in the Debian system, "debconf" is both an actual package, and provided by the debconf\-tiny package\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Missing
is the number of package names that were referenced in a dependency but were not provided by any package\&. Missing packages may be an evidence if a full distribution is not accessed, or if a package (real or virtual) has been dropped from the distribution\&. Usually they are referenced from Conflicts or Breaks statements\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Total distinct
versions is the number of package versions found in the cache\&. If more than one distribution is being accessed (for instance, "stable" and "unstable"), this value can be considerably larger than the number of total package names\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
Total dependencies
is the number of dependency relationships claimed by all of the packages in the cache\&.
.RE
.sp
.RE
.PP
\fBshowsrc\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
showsrc
displays all the source package records that match the given package names\&. All versions are shown, as well as all records that declare the name to be a binary package\&. Use
\fB\-\-only\-source\fR
to display only source package names\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdump\fR
.RS 4
dump
shows a short listing of every package in the cache\&. It is primarily for debugging\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdumpavail\fR
.RS 4
dumpavail
prints out an available list to stdout\&. This is suitable for use with
\fBdpkg\fR(1)
and is used by the
\fBdselect\fR(1)
method\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBunmet\fR
.RS 4
unmet
displays a summary of all unmet dependencies in the package cache\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBshow\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
show
performs a function similar to
\fBdpkg \-\-print\-avail\fR; it displays the package records for the named packages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBsearch\fR \fB\fIregex\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
search
performs a full text search on all available package lists for the POSIX regex pattern given, see
\fBregex\fR(7)\&. It searches the package names and the descriptions for an occurrence of the regular expression and prints out the package name and the short description, including virtual package names\&. If
\fB\-\-full\fR
is given then output identical to
show
is produced for each matched package, and if
\fB\-\-names\-only\fR
is given then the long description is not searched, only the package name and provided packages are\&.
.sp
Separate arguments can be used to specify multiple search patterns that are and\*(Aqed together\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdepends\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
depends
shows a listing of each dependency a package has and all the possible other packages that can fulfill that dependency\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBrdepends\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
rdepends
shows a listing of each reverse dependency a package has\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpkgnames\fR [\fIprefix\fR]
.RS 4
This command prints the name of each package APT knows\&. The optional argument is a prefix match to filter the name list\&. The output is suitable for use in a shell tab complete function and the output is generated extremely quickly\&. This command is best used with the
\fB\-\-generate\fR
option\&.
.sp
Note that a package which APT knows of is not necessarily available to download, installable or installed, e\&.g\&. virtual packages are also listed in the generated list\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBdotty\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
dotty
takes a list of packages on the command line and generates output suitable for use by dotty from the
\m[blue]\fBGraphViz\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
package\&. The result will be a set of nodes and edges representing the relationships between the packages\&. By default the given packages will trace out all dependent packages; this can produce a very large graph\&. To limit the output to only the packages listed on the command line, set the
APT::Cache::GivenOnly
option\&.
.sp
The resulting nodes will have several shapes; normal packages are boxes, pure virtual packages are triangles, mixed virtual packages are diamonds, missing packages are hexagons\&. Orange boxes mean recursion was stopped (leaf packages), blue lines are pre\-depends, green lines are conflicts\&.
.sp
Caution, dotty cannot graph larger sets of packages\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBxvcg\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
The same as
dotty, only for xvcg from the
\m[blue]\fBVCG tool\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBpolicy\fR [\fIpkg\fR\&...]
.RS 4
policy
is meant to help debug issues relating to the preferences file\&. With no arguments it will print out the priorities of each source\&. Otherwise it prints out detailed information about the priority selection of the named package\&.
.RE
.PP
\fBmadison\fR \fB\fIpkg\fR\fR\fB\&...\fR
.RS 4
apt\-cache\*(Aqs
madison
command attempts to mimic the output format and a subset of the functionality of the Debian archive management tool,
madison\&. It displays available versions of a package in a tabular format\&. Unlike the original
madison, it can only display information for the architecture for which APT has retrieved package lists (APT::Architecture)\&.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
All command line options may be set using the configuration file, the descriptions indicate the configuration option to set\&. For boolean options you can override the config file by using something like
\fB\-f\-\fR,\fB\-\-no\-f\fR,
\fB\-f=no\fR
or several other variations\&.
.PP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-pkg\-cache\fR
.RS 4
Select the file to store the package cache\&. The package cache is the primary cache used by all operations\&. Configuration Item:
Dir::Cache::pkgcache\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-src\-cache\fR
.RS 4
Select the file to store the source cache\&. The source is used only by
gencaches
and it stores a parsed version of the package information from remote sources\&. When building the package cache the source cache is used to avoid reparsing all of the package files\&. Configuration Item:
Dir::Cache::srcpkgcache\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
.RS 4
Quiet; produces output suitable for logging, omitting progress indicators\&. More q\*(Aqs will produce more quietness up to a maximum of 2\&. You can also use
\fB\-q=#\fR
to set the quietness level, overriding the configuration file\&. Configuration Item:
quiet\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-important\fR

.RS 4
Per default the
\fBdepends\fR

e\&.g\&.
APT::Cache::ShowRecommends\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-implicit\fR
.RS 4
Per default
\fBdepends\fR
and
\fBrdepends\fR
print only dependencies explicitly expressed in the metadata\&. With this flag it will also show dependencies implicitly added based on the encountered data\&. A
Conflicts: foo
e\&.g\&. expresses implicitly that this package also conflicts with the package foo from any other architecture\&. Configuration Item:
APT::Cache::ShowImplicit\&.

\fB\-\-no\-all\-versions\fR\&. If
\fB\-\-no\-all\-versions\fR
is specified, only the candidate version will be displayed (the one which would be selected for installation)\&. This option is only applicable to the
show

APT::Cache::AllVersions\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-generate\fR
